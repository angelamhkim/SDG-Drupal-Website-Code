<p>Our academic partnerships have made it possible to localize the SDGs in L.A.&nbsp;They have been a force multiplier for that progress, and an opportunity to introduce the City’s work to undergraduate and graduate students from various
  universities. Through these partnerships, student’s findings have and will continue to help the City in implementing policies inclusive of the <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/" style="color:#0083BF;" target="_blank">United Nations
    Sustainable Development Goals</a>. The project teams play a key role in assisting the City to identify gaps in aligning plans and practices while highlighting cross-cutting issue areas for mobilizing multi-stakeholder partnerships. Over 100
  undergraduate and graduate students have been engaged in the SDG localization efforts in Los Angeles to date.</p>
