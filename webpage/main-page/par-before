      <td width="70%">The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), otherwise known as the <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs" style="color:#0083BF;" target="_blank">2030 Agenda</a>, are a group of 17 goals and 169&nbsp;targets. The SDGs
        build on the success of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and were drafted and adopted at the UN General Assembly in 2015. The SDGs aim to address social inequality, economic growth, environmental preservation, among other global
        development challenges. In 2015, the United Nations established the 2030 Global Agenda for Sustainable Development consisting of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These goals address the social, environmental and economic issues that
        societies face in today’s world. While formulated for national governments, subnational groups worldwide have attempted to adopt the SDGs in planning, implementing, and monitoring. Los Angeles stands at the forefront of this movement in its
        city-wide effort to align plans and goals to the SDGs, while also mobilizing multi-stakeholder initiatives at the goals’ intersections. Click on the icons below to learn more about each <a href="/node/2276" style="color:#0083BF;">Sustainable
