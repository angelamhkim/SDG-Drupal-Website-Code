  <meta charset="utf-8">The City of Los Angeles is fortunate to be located within a globally recognized hotspot of native biodiversity. While Los Angeles is a biodiversity jewel, this designation also means that the biodiversity here is threatened,
  and innovative strategies are needed to ensure its resilience and sustainability. A student team worked with the Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation and Environment for 10 weeks to develop methodologies to measure biodiversity metrics as part of the
  Los Angeles Biodiversity Index.

<p>The City of Los Angeles comprises a unique urban ecosystem -- nestled between the Pacific Ocean and vast mountain ranges. Despite being an urban center, Los Angeles has an abundance of rich native wildlife within City limits. As part of the 2020
  Los Angeles SDG Summer Cohort, our student group conducted research relevant to SDG 15: Life on Land. Utilizing this central goal of contributing to the City’s engagement with biodiversity, we each took on an individual project in order to
  understand and measure indicators that are a part of the <a

</p>
<p style="color: rgb(16, 162, 198)">────────</p>
<p>Throughout our internship with the Los Angeles Mayor’s Office, our team was able to identify the strengths of the SDGs framework as it relates to biodiversity. We examined appropriate measures of sustainable development to understand how community
  members can coexist with Los Angeles’ native species. Each of our eight projects further the measurement of the L.A. Biodiversity Index and create a guide for L.A.’s Bureau of Sanitation and Environment. We worked to identify key data gaps, locate
  areas for improvement, and make biodiversity recommendations.</p>
<p>Our findings show that having a diverse ecosystem not only strengthens environmental quality, but also enriches City growth. Embracing and localizing the SDG framework in Los Angeles is crucial to build Sustainable Cities and Communities and
  protect Life on Land.</p>
